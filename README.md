Our website uses bootstrap Version 5.3.1 for CSS. Download bootstrap at [bootstrap.com](https://getbootstrap.com/)
### Testing
Our website uses the software Selenium and Python's unittest library to run tests. 

Tests are run from the file [main-branch]testing/tests.py

### Coding standard
- All variables are in English, start with lowercase letters and subsequent words start with uppercase letters (camelCase). Eventual snake_case is from/for bootstrap.
- We use four blank spaces for indentation.
- All test functions have to start with "test".
- English file names only contain lowercase letters.
- Comments are positioned above the code it describes, are only in English and start with lowercase letters in Python but start with uppercase letters in HTML and CSS.
- Python files follow the Black Formatter standard and Pylint with the exception of C0111 and method-naming-style=camelCase.

### Development environment
- Code Editor: Visual Studio Code 2022 Version 1.66
- Google Chrome is the browser we use for testing.
- We use Windows 10 as our operating system.
  
#### Programming languages
- HTML5 for creating websites
